Hi Everyone,

Please review my application built using .NET Core 8 MVC. I have implemented the following modules:

User Registration: Allows users to register on the platform.
Assign Role: Assign roles to users.
Password Policy: Set password policies from the UI, including length and strength requirements.
Generate Password: Automatically generate passwords through the application.
Send Password: Send generated passwords to users via SMTP server.
User Login: Users can log in with their credentials.
Forgot Password: If a user forgets their password, they can enter their email, and the application will send a new password, which the user can use to log in and set a stronger password.
Please review my code and support me with any feedback or suggestions.

Thank you!
